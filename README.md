# AI Hackathon Team 5

Welcome to the repository for **AI Hackathon Team 5**!

## Project Overview

Our project focuses on intelligent code snippet generation using AI models. It enables users to input natural language prompts and receive relevant, context-aware code snippets in various programming languages. Key features include prompt analysis, multi-language support, and seamless integration for developers to accelerate coding tasks.ls, and main features.

## Usage


This application provides an interactive environment for generating and refining code snippets. Simply enter your code requirements, and the app will guide you through the process, allowing you to iteratively improve your code based on further input.

Key features:
- **Interactive Code Generation:** Submit your requirements and receive tailored code suggestions.
- **Refinement:** Continuously refine your code by providing additional feedback or requirements.
- **Security Guardrails:** The app automatically checks for and prevents the generation of vulnerable code.
- **Download Option:** For large code snippets, you can easily download the results for use in your projects.

To get started, launch the app and follow the on-screen instructions to begin your coding session.
